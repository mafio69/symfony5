# Bitnami Symfony Development Container

> Note that this is a development container. If a Symfony app is not already
> present, `composer create-project symfony/skeleton $SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME`
> is run to create a Symfony 4.x project.
>
> Include a non null value in the `$SYMFONY_SKIP_DB` envvar/flag, to skip over
> installing `symfony/orm-pack`.

## TL;DR

### Local workspace

```console
$ mkdir ~/myapp && cd ~/myapp
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

## Introduction

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/), is a web application framework written in [PHP](http://www.php.net) under [MIT License](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/license.html).

The Bitnami Symfony Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Symfony development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Symfony Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Symfony Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Symfony application:

```console
$ mkdir ~/myapp
$ cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```console
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Set a few environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  myapp:
    image: 'bitnami/symfony:1'
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
    environment:
      - SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME=myapp
      - MARIADB_HOST=mariadb
      - MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - MARIADB_USER=bobby
      - MARIADB_PASSWORD=tables
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=myapp
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:10.3'
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_USER=bobby
      - MARIADB_PASSWORD=tables
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=myapp
```

Finally launch the Symfony application development environment using:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

The above command creates a container service for Symfony development and bootstraps a new Symfony application, named `myapp` in working directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

After the built-in PHP application server has been started, visit http://localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the Symfony welcome page.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Symfony Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```console
$ docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```
where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples:

- Create a new project named `foo`:

  ```console
  $ docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject foo
  ```

- Create a new project named `bar` which uses Symfony version `2.5.0`

  ```console
  $ docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject "bar 2.5.0"
  ```

  Note: In the above two examples the `docker-compose.yml` file should be updated so that the `SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME` specifies the project name that should be served my the PHP application server.

## Issues

If you encountered a problem running this container, you can file an [issue](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/issues/new). For us to provide better support, be sure to include the following information in your issue:

- Host OS and version (`$ uname -a`)
